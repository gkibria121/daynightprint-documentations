# Product Management

To show an item on the **customer-facing form**, we need to add **Vendor Products**. Here's how the process works:

1. **Create a Product**  
   Start by creating a product with the following details:

   - **Product Name**
   - **Product Image**

2. **Create a Vendor Product**  
   A vendor product links a product to a vendor and includes vendor-specific details such as:

   - Description
   - Pricing (if applicable)
   - Availability or delivery options

3. **Add Description**  
   The description added in the vendor product will be visible to customers in the form.

### Where to Manage

- **Products Menu**  
  Manage the base products available in your system.

- **Vendors Menu**  
  Manage all registered vendors.

- **Vendor Products Menu**  
  To show an item on the customer-facing form, we need to add vendor products here. This is where products are linked to specific vendors and enhanced with relevant descriptions and options.

Once vendor products are set up properly, they will appear in the customer-facing form.
