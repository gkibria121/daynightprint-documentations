# How to Create a Vendor Product

To show a product on the customer-facing form, you must create a **Vendor Product**. Here's how:

## Step 1: Go to the Vendor Products Menu

Navigate to the **Vendor Products** menu option, then click on **Add New Vendor Product**. This will open the vendor product creation form.

## Step 2: Fill Out Basic Information

The first section is **Basic Information**, which includes:

- **Product**: Select the product from the list of existing products.
- **Vendor**: Select the vendor from the list of registered vendors.
- **Rating**: Set a rating to give this vendor priority if the same product is available from multiple vendors.
- **VAT Rate**: Define the VAT rate to be used for tax calculations.
- **Should Calculate Price**: Choose `Yes` or `No` using radio buttons.
  - If set to **Yes**, the system will attempt to calculate the price dynamically based on customer input.
  - ⚠️ This feature is currently in **Beta** mode.

## Step 3: Add Additional Configuration

After completing the basic information, you will need to fill out the following sections:

- **Pricing Rules**
- **Pricing Rule Meta**
- **Delivery Options**
- **Quantity Pricing**

Each of these sections is discussed below in detail.

> 📌 Proper configuration of these sections ensures the vendor product will work correctly in pricing and delivery flows.
