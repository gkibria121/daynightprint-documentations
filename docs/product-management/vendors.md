## Alternative: Import Vendors via CSV

You can also add vendors by importing a CSV file.

**CSV format should be:**

```

name,email,streetAddress,place,city,postCode

```

Each row in the CSV represents a vendor. Make sure:

- All fields are provided for each vendor.
- The email address is unique across all vendors.

The vendor is now added and can be linked to products using the Vendor Products menu.

```

```
